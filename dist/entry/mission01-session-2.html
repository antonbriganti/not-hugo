<p>We got enough distance between us and the miners that we can recoup and ask some questions. Mercury kept a big distance from us, unclear why though. Maybe it’s harder to re-associate than de-associate? But surely Captain is the dominant persona so it’d be easier for him to take back over.  We spoke to the remaining security guy, and he was talking about some kind of Black Forces ~~squad~~ unit being down in the mines. I wasn’t paying attention to the particulars until he mentioned the politicians being graded and put in front of something that was glowing red. They apparently were showing an almost religious reverence to the object. I don’t anything about playing soldier but this stuff is my speciality. More to ask for later, but for now we’ve got to move back to the base and debrief further, so says the Captain.</p>
<div class="break">...</div>
<p>I was thinking about what the politician was saying after being expose to the Red Object (henceforth referred to as R.O. until we find the real name for it). Is “recalling how was once thought” talking about how this is some kind of ‘reawakened’ religion? Is the R.O. something that was previously worshipped and now it’s been uncovered again?</p>
<p>Who are the “lost minds”?  Can’t just be the union miners, especially if they’ve go the Special Ops guys with them. It might mean all of Castiria, maybe even all of Telegeta IV. If they expect  us to “tremble at what’s to come”, I have to assume they want to spread this thing and bring people under the same psychosis they put the political under. Can’t be easy to try and bring everyone to see the R.O.. Maybe it’s not the psychosis they want to spread, maybe it’s just the old religion . I wonder if they’ve got any pamphlets or gospels they can share with me. Should we run into them again, I’ll have to ask for something.</p>
<div class="break">...</div>
<p>Asivilliamism state that might makes right, and that there is no problem that can’t be solved without force. It also states that things in cages can’t be trusted and that there is no rain without a rainbow. I’m not sure what they’re trying to say with those last two but I’m strongly feeling that they’re not something with the might thing. I am getting destroyed out here, Ithiki’s taking a beating and my systems keep saying “STUNNED”. I know now is not the best time to journal but all I can do is wait for Ithiki to recover.</p>
<div class="break">...</div>
<p><em>The following text is written in a much more frantic and aggressive font than the other parts, getting progressively messier as it continues</em></p>
<p>I am so mad I am so mad I am so mad I am so mad</p>
<p>I will win I will win I will win I will win</p>
<p>Please stop getting stunned Please stop getting stunned Please stop getting stunned Please stop getting stunned</p>
<div class="break">...</div>
<p>Alright well that was the worst fight I’ve ever been in. Maybe it’s time to think like a soldier and consider where I’m best used on the battlefield because if this happens to me again I will not be able to achieve anything I want to do - I didn’t talk to Mercury, I didn’t ask for their gospel and I don’t even know why they want that stupid politician.</p>
<p>Ithiki’s in bad shape so now I’m going to have to figure out how a way to repair him. I hope I kept some tape in my supplies or something nearby. I guess I can always ask the mechanic to help out too.</p>
