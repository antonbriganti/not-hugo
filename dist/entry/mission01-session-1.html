    <h3>Mission Briefing</h3>
    <h4>2.5.7.12 <span class="small-text">R.D.</span></h4>
</div>
<p>Turns out the answer is “unit”. Today, the newly formed Unit 2 met in person, and I’m happy to report we are definitely  an interesting bunch. There’s me, a dog man, the poor mechanic who had his mech destroyed, and our captain. Our first mission is very underwhelming- we’re to play protection some politician during a strike conversation. The military being used to intimidate the people isn’t anything new, so I hope our future missions will reveal some further intrigue or at least expose me to more people outside of combat. I am sympathetic to the workers so I hope we don’t have to do any enforcement. I don’t think everyone agrees though, the dog man seemed almost keen to be let off the leash on them. Oh god is it in poor taste to use that euphemism about him?</p>
<p>By far the most interesting thing about our unit is our Captain. The man himself seems to be your standard soldier type but he’s gone through some kind of process where he’s been psychologically separated from himself in some way. When he’s in his mech, he will be a different entity? personality? known as Mercury. There are some rules about Mercury which dictate our interactions with them, primarily to do with not discussing the outside world and not calling them captain. This, of course, only makes me want to do it more. A severed persona is fascinating, practically unheard of! It’s almost like a voluntary dissociative identity disorder. A Why do these restrictions exist? What happens to Mercury outside the mech? Hell, what happens to the Captain inside? Why do we have to kill him if he’s the one in control of the mech. Endless questions. The study of the mind isn’t my forte but I still can’t deny my academic curiosity.</p>
<p>The mission starts tomorrow so I’ll get a chance to see it in action. I hope Mercury isn’t just a murderous persona the Captain is trying to slide by us for plausible deniability for my curiosity’s sake, as well as for those striking miners.</p>

<p>We’re enrolee to the mines. The Captain isn’t in his mech. Shame, talking to Mercury would have been more interesting than whatever the politicians are talking about. At least this gives me a chance to journal and reason. I thought of this last night what is the dif- <em>The writing trails into a scribble</em></p>
<p>I got distracted, the politician mentioned gambling and I thought to ask about the legality of it in Castiria. Perhaps when we get some time off, I’ll indulge a little bit.</p>
<div class="break">...</div>
<p>We’re on the retreat from the mines. I had the feeling this wasn’t ever going to be a peaceful negotiation, but I didn’t think it would be the workers who attacked. Combat went smoothly enough, I took some hits but we all pulled through. I have to admit, I’m impressed, near jealous of my unit’s skills. Hacking, shooting, protection - it’s all very spectacular stuff. It requires thinking and precision, nothing like my close range work. The mechanic seems to have found his niche with his new mech as well, how positive for him.</p>
<p>Mercury seems to be genuinely real too. I found it hard to communicate during battle but he sounded naïve, almost younger when he spoke. He mentioned waves and not enemies or combatants like you would think a soldier would say. Is this some kind of psychological protection to prevent from being scarred from combat? Is that why they prefer technical weaponry?</p>
<p>And the last question from this little encounter, what the hell is that politician saying? “Lost minds recall quickly now how they once thought, earth drawn from cluttered lungs lets them newly breath poison, let us tremble at what is to come”. Is this a Castirian mantra? Based on the overall reaction, seems not, but it has that sort of religious vibe to it…</p>
<p>I shouldn’t admit it but I’m excited to see how this all pans out. This is far more interesting than strikebreaking.</p>
