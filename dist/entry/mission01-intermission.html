<p>I had a dream last night. A blonde man told me he walked our path and tells our story to thousands with a voice that reaches across the diaspora. Thousands seems minuscule in comparison to the trillions that exist, but who am I to judge when I’m only telling our story to a journal.</p>
<p>I never used to put stock in the meaning of dreams, but in my adult years I tend to view them as my subconscious trying to inform my conscious of something important. Then again, the blonde man was a complete stranger and I don’t need to speak to thousands so who knows what my brain is trying to tell me. Maybe it’s a reminder to journal more?</p>

<p>Today I worked with some of the Castirian engineers to improve Ithiki. After seeing that mech fly during the exercise, I was inspired to try it myself. The engineers seemed surprised that a Lancer pilot needed help to outfit his own robot, but I’ve never been one to understand the mechanics of these things. Piloting these mechs has always been a tool to aid my research, a literal vehicle to get close to where battlefields where the ideologies are formed and tested.</p>

<p>The briefing is tomorrow, so I guess I’ll get to meet my team officially. What’s the military term for team? Squad? I spent some time learning about some of the wildlife on the planet as well as the phenomena known as The Haze. I can’t believe they haven’t figured out the cause of the Haze, more more incredibly, I can’t believe there isn’t some kind of religion formed around it.</p>
