A new world, a new journal, but still the same goal. I've been told that there's been some political tensions in the area so I'm hoping that I'll be able to learn some new ideologies or beliefs from it all. I remain hopeful that I can create the Unified Belief before I die, but I must admit that there are times where I feel I am collecting pieces of a puzzle that don't go together with what I've scribed so far. At the very least, my work can be used as an archive of different belief systems. Though I will have to actually digitise all my notes for that to be achieved. 

Today I participated in a training exercise with the Castirian Army with some fellow pilots. We won the mission where our task was something called "controlling the point", and seemingly passed some kind of test to show we're good enough. I was told that I performed well in the mission, but I can't say I can tell why. Anybody can swing a sword, children do it for play even, so how is what I do anything special or noteworthy. 

I understand that I'll get to meet my team soon at some kind of chateau. I hope they prove to be interesting or remarkable in some way.
