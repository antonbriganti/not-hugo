# not hugo 

have you ever thought to yourself "I want to use Hugo but with a lot less functionality and also not as good"? 

this repo is a learning task for how I can create a static site generator in golang. I was originally doing it with my repo [maxwell-log](https://github.com/antonbriganti/maxwell-log) in mind. 

it's not very good but I learned something *and* I had fun. isn't that why we build things?
